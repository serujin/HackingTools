Hi, if you are reading this is because you need some help to deploy the project, let's see what can we do:

- Open a terminal.
- Clone this repository on your machine (git clone https://github.com/serujin/HackingTools.git).
- Go to the directory created (cd HackingTools).
- Create a virtual enviroment to allow Django do his magic and activate it (https://help.dreamhost.com/hc/es/articles/115000695551-Instalar-y-usar-virtualenv-con-Python-3).
- Install all requirements (pip3 install -r requirements.txt).
- Go to the folder TIC_SERVER (cd TIC_SERVER).
- Run some commands before starting:
	- python3 .\manage.py makemigrations (check for changes on the DB)
	- python3 .\manage.py migrate (apply those changes on the DB)
	- python3 .\manage.py collectstatic (check if new files are added)
- Create a service or start manually the server on a terminal (command to start: python3 .\manage.py runserver "IP":"PORT")*

*Obviously, change the port and the ip to the desired ones.
